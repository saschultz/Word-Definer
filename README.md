Dictionary Builder Webpage

#### A page that will allow you to build your own dictionary, 04.28.2017

#### By Sara Schultz

## Description

As the second independent project at Epicodus as a Ruby student, this project was to create a website for kids where they can enter words they would like to add to their online dictionary. The site will add each word to their dictionary list, and when each word is clicked on, they are taken to a page where they can enter the definition(s) for the word.

## Known Bugs

They id method is not following each words definitions. To the user, this makes it so that each definition they add will add to every word they've entered, not just the current word they are working on.
